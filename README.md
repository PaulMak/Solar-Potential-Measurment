# Solar-Potential-Measurment
An experiment to find at which hour of the day the sun produces a higher voltage. The experiment was carried out by using an 
experimental organ containing a solar panel and an arduino uno microcontroller connected to a PC. The solar panel was cannected to 
the ground and A0 pin on the arduino board through a voltage divider although that might not be necessary if you are using a solar panel 
that provides voltages lower than 12 volts. You can find more information about the project and the team that carried it out here:
